This is my project for looking at Real Estate Data in Vancouver

My step process will be 
1. Parse Data from Website
    Notes: Data collected for current postings
           Removed Lots and Multifamilies because there seems to be quite a bit of missing data. In the future will go back to revise
2. Clean data 
3. Basic analysis of data
4. Visualization of data (correlation heatmaps)
5. Do scan of 2020 data to see prices in comparison to high prices and median
6. Predict future prices
